# longBinaryStreamToHex
Converts a (long) string of binary digits (encoded as ASCII Characters) to an ASCII encoded hexadecimal String

First intended as a helper for a submit to a codegolf challenge I decided to make this a standalone more useful program capable of doing its job for more than just the one hard coded binary string I was interested in.
